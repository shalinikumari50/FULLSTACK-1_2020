    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify">Currently, I am an Computer Science undergraduate at GLA University, Mathura and I love learning new skills. Learning is a way of life for me. I am determined to achieve my goals and I am ready to work day in and day out to make that a reality. I have been an excellent student throughout and I believe that whatever you do, give it your best.<br>

        <br>My principles have always stood along with me and made me what I am today. I enjoy coding and solving problems. I am passionate about web development. So far, I have learnt Java, C and Python as my strong programming languages. I use tools like Intellij IDE, Pycharm, Visual Studio and git for my coding. I have also grown my knowledge about IIOT. I have worked with Arduino and Node MCU. I am continuously looking for opportunities to learn new programming languages and frameworks as I relish growing my skills and then using them to build something productive.<br>
        
        <br>Software industry has always fascinated me. I love the way how everything is being available to us on our fingertips through our smartphones now-a-days. Just few clicks can get the things going. I want to contribute to this industry by being a part of a development team that would serve the people with a product which would solve their problem. </p>
